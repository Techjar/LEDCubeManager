# LED Cube Manager
You need ffmpeg to play audio. Get it at http://www.ffmpeg.org

Builds can be found at http://ci.techjargaming.com/job/LED%20Cube%20Manager/

## Building
You need to add lombok.jar (in lib directory) to your IDE's annotation processors.

## Extra Notes
This is the branch for the LED strip behind my desk.
